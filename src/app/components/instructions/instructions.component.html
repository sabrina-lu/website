    Evil reveals itself and Merlin looks into the future
    True Evil is rampant in the land. Arthur represents the future of Britain, a promise of prosperity and honor, yet hidden among his brave warriors are Mordred's unscrupulous miniona.
    The forces of Evil are few in number but have knowledge of each other and remain hidden from all but one of Arthur's servants. Merlin alone knows the agents of Evil, but he must speak of his only in riddles.If his true identity is discovered all will be lost.
    
    After all the players know their loyalty, the leader must ensure that all the Evil players know each other and that Merlin knows all the Evil players.
