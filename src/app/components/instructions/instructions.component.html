    Evil reveals itself and Merlin looks into the future
    True Evil is rampant in the land. Arthur represents the future of Britain, a promise of prosperity and honor, yet hidden among his brave warriors are Mordred's unscrupulous miniona.
    The forces of Evil are few in number but have knowledge of each other and remain hidden from all but one of Arthur's servants. Merlin alone knows the agents of Evil, but he must speak of his only in riddles.If his true identity is discovered all will be lost.
    
    After all the players know their loyalty, the leader must ensure that all the Evil players know each other and that Merlin knows all the Evil players by repeating the following script:
    Everyone close your eyes and extend your hand info a fist in front of you.
    Minions of Mordred open your eyes and look around so that you know all agents of Evil.
    Minions of Mordred close your eyes.
    All players should have their eyes closed and hands in a fist in front of them.
    Minions of Mordred - extend your thumb so that Merlin will know of you.
    Merlin, open your eyes and see the agents of evil.
    Minions of Mordred - put your thumbs down and re-form your hands into a fist
    Merlin, close your eyes.
    All players have their eyes closed and hands in a fist in front of them
    Everyone open your eyes.
